## Ways to Contribute

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Code** | Gateway features, bug fixes, new providers, new tools |
| **Training Data** | New JSONL examples for the [Wrench model](https://github.com/ClankLabs/wrench-training-data) |
| **Benchmark** | Test cases that push tool-calling accuracy |
| **Bug Reports** | File [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ClankLabs/Clank/issues) with steps to reproduce |
| **Documentation** | Improvements to guides, inline comments, or wiki pages |

## Code Style

- TypeScript with semicolons
- Keep it simple — if a function does one thing well, that's enough
- Use descriptive names. Avoid abbreviations unless universal (e.g., `config`, `msg`)
- Follow existing patterns. When in doubt, look at a neighboring file
- No unnecessary abstractions — three similar lines > a premature helper

---

## Training Data Format

Wrench training data lives in the [wrench-training-data](https://github.com/ClankLabs/wrench-training-data) repo as JSONL files. Each line is a self-contained JSON object with a `conversations` array.

Roles: `system`, `user`, `assistant`, `tool`.

Tool calls use the fenced ` ```tool_call ` block format. Tool results use the `tool` role.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "conversations": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant with access to tools." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "What files are in the current directory?" },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "I'll list the files for you.\n\n```tool_call\n{\"name\": \"list_directory\", \"arguments\": {\"path\": \".\"}}\n```" },
    { "role": "tool", "content": "README.md\npackage.json\nsrc/\ntsconfig.json" },
    { "role": "assistant", "content": "The current directory contains README.md, package.json, a src/ folder, and tsconfig.json." }
  ]
}
```

Each example should demonstrate a realistic, complete interaction. Include the system prompt, at least one user turn, and the full tool-call round trip.
