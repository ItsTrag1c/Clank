# Changelog

All notable changes to Clank will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Two-tier context compaction** — critical for local model performance:
  - Tier 1 (fast): system prompt budgeting, tool result dedup, message truncation, aggressive dropping
  - Tier 2 (LLM-summarized): model generates conversation recap replacing oldest messages. Preserves meaning over long sessions.
  - Token budgeting: reserves 25% for response, budgets system prompt separately from conversation
- **`clank update`** — update to latest npm version, preserves config/sessions/memory, restarts gateway

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-22

### Security Hardening
- **Bash tool:** expanded blocklist from 5 to 25 patterns — covers flag variations, shell-in-shell, encoded payloads, PowerShell, system damage commands
- **Path traversal:** all file tools (read, write, edit, list, search, glob) now enforce workspace containment via `guardPath()` — blocks absolute paths and `../` traversal outside workspace
- **Config redaction:** API keys, bot tokens, and auth tokens are stripped from config before exposing to LLM context or WebSocket clients
- **Prototype pollution:** config.set RPC blocks `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` keys
- **SSRF protection:** web_fetch blocks localhost, cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254), .internal/.local hostnames, file:// protocol
- **Gateway auth:** auto-generates token on startup if mode is "token" but no token configured — prevents accidental open gateways
- **Status endpoint:** /status now requires Bearer token authentication
- **Tool confirmations:** gateway respects autoApprove config instead of blindly approving — 30s timeout defaults to deny
- **.gitignore:** added config.json5, *.pem, *.key, credentials.json to prevent accidental secret commits

### Bug Fixes
- **Telegram bot not responding:** `bot.start()` was blocking (awaited) which prevented the gateway from finishing startup. Now runs non-blocking with `onStart` callback.
- **Telegram allowFrom:** now matches both `@username` and numeric user IDs (was only matching numeric)
- **grammY missing:** added as real dependency (was dynamic import that failed silently)
- **Local server URL not saved:** setup wizard now saves detected server baseUrl for all local providers (was only saving Ollama)
- **Port conflict:** default port changed to 18790 (was 18789, conflicted with OpenClaw/Claude Code)
- **--web flag:** `clank chat --web` now auto-starts gateway and opens browser
- **Gateway text/message param:** accepts both `message` and `text` fields from clients

### Added
- **TUI:** rich terminal UI with streaming, tool cards, thinking blocks, agent/session/model pickers, slash commands, shell integration (`!command`)
- **Web Control UI:** 8-panel dashboard — Chat, Agents, Sessions, Config (JSON editor), Pipelines, Cron, Logs, Channels
- **Telegram slash commands:** /help, /status, /agents, /agent, /sessions, /new, /reset, /model, /think
- **CLI commands:** tui, dashboard, pipeline, cron, channels, uninstall
- **Background gateway:** runs as detached process, Telegram/Discord stay alive while CLI/TUI/Web run on top
- **Gateway singleton:** refuses to start if already running on the port
- **Self-config tools (8):** config, manage_channel, manage_agent, manage_model, manage_session, manage_cron, gateway_status, send_message
- **Google Gemini provider** with streaming and function calling
- **Memory system:** TF-IDF cosine similarity with decay scoring, categorized storage
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM for API keys, PIN hashing with timing-safe comparison
- **Web search:** Brave Search API integration
- **Config hot-reload:** watches config.json5 for changes
- **`clank uninstall`:** removes all data, daemon, and npm package

### Changed
- Default command (`clank` with no args) starts gateway in background then launches TUI
- `clank gateway start` now runs in background by default (`--foreground` for blocking mode)
- `clank gateway restart` fully implemented (stop + start)
- Protocol updated to v1 spec with 17 RPC methods and 11 event types

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-22

Initial release — Clank Gateway foundation.

### Architecture
- Single gateway daemon (HTTP + WebSocket on port 18789)
- WebSocket JSON-RPC protocol v1 with 17 RPC methods and 11 event types
- All interfaces are equal — CLI, TUI, Web UI, Telegram, Discord

### Engine
- AgentEngine with ReAct loop (stream → tool calls → execute → loop, max 50 iterations)
- Pluggable ContextEngine with compaction optimized for local models (60% threshold vs 80% cloud)
- Tool tiering: full/core/auto — reduces tool count for smaller models
- PromptFallbackProvider for models without native function calling

### Providers
- Ollama (primary) — auto-detect, dynamic context window, tool support checking
- Anthropic Claude — Messages API with SSE streaming
- OpenAI — also covers LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp (OpenAI-compatible)
- Google Gemini — streaming with function calling
- Provider router with fallback chain and local server auto-detection
- Reasoning/thinking content support (Qwen, DeepSeek, etc.)

### Tools (18 total)
- **Core (10):** read_file, write_file, edit_file, list_directory, search_files, glob_files, bash, git, web_search (Brave), web_fetch
- **Self-config (8):** config, manage_channel, manage_agent, manage_model, manage_session, manage_cron, gateway_status, send_message

### Interfaces
- **CLI:** 12 commands — chat, gateway, setup, fix, models, agents, daemon, tui, dashboard, pipeline, cron, channels
- **TUI:** Rich terminal UI with streaming, tool cards, thinking blocks, agent/session/model pickers, slash commands, shell integration
- **Web Control UI:** 8-panel SPA — Chat, Agents, Sessions, Config (JSON editor), Pipelines, Cron, Logs, Channels
- **Telegram:** Full adapter with slash commands, typing indicators, response chunking, permission allowlists, group mention checking
- **Discord:** Full adapter with typing, reply threading, response chunking

### Multi-Agent
- Named agents with separate models, workspaces, and tool access
- Config-driven routing with binding priority tiers (peer → guild → team → channel → default)
- Normalized session keys for cross-channel continuity (dm:telegram:123, cli:main, etc.)

### Systems
- **Memory:** TF-IDF cosine similarity with decay scoring, categorized storage (identity/knowledge/lessons/context)
- **Sessions:** JSON transcript persistence, prune/cap/reset, cross-channel shared sessions
- **Config:** JSON5 with env var substitution, hot-reload watcher, defaults with deep merge
- **Cron:** JSONL job store, 30s tick interval, run logging, retry tracking
- **Pipelines:** Sequential step execution with agent handoffs, state persistence
- **Plugins:** Discovery (~/.clank/plugins/ + node_modules/clank-plugin-*), 25+ hook types
- **Heartbeat:** Periodic probes from HEARTBEAT.md, quiet hours
- **Voice:** TTS (ElevenLabs + piper), STT (whisper.cpp)
- **Daemon:** Cross-platform service — macOS (launchd), Windows (Task Scheduler), Linux (systemd)

### Security
- AES-256-GCM encryption for API keys (PBKDF2, 100K iterations)
- PIN verification with timing-safe comparison
- 3-tier tool safety system (low/medium/high) with auto-approve settings
- Gateway binds to localhost by default, token-based auth

### Onboarding
- `clank setup` wizard — Quick Start (under 2 minutes) and Advanced flows
- Auto-detects local model servers (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM)
- Configures cloud providers, Telegram, Discord, Brave Search, voice, agents
- `clank fix` diagnostics with auto-repair

### Workspace
- Bootstrap templates: SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, BOOTSTRAP.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md
- System prompt builder loads workspace files + project context (.clank.md)
